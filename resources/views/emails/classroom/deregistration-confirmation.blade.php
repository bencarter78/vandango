    <p>Hello {!! $user->first_name !!}</p>
    <p>
        This is confirmation that your upcoming place on the <strong>{!! $timetable->course->name !!}</strong> course
        has been cancelled. If you already know why this has happened then thatâ€™s great, otherwise can you please
        contact your manager to review this. Hopefully we will see you on a future course.
    </p>
    <p>Thank you</p>
